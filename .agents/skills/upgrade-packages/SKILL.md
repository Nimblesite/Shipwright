# Upgrade Packages

Upgrade all project dependencies to their latest compatible (or latest major, if `--major`) versions.

## Arguments

- `--check-only` — List outdated packages without upgrading. Stop after Step 2.
- `--major` — Include major version bumps (breaking changes). Without this flag, stay within semver-compatible ranges.
- Any other argument is treated as a specific package name to upgrade (instead of all packages).

## Step 1 — Detect language and package manager

This repo has TWO package ecosystems. Process both.

| Manifest file | Language | Package manager |
|---|---|---|
| `Cargo.toml` (workspace root) + `crates/*/Cargo.toml` | Rust | cargo |
| `tools/validate-manifest/package.json` | Node.js | npm (no lockfile committed yet — verify before running) |

If a future client SDK adds `clients/dart/pubspec.yaml`, `clients/dotnet/*.csproj`, `clients/kotlin/build.gradle*`, or `clients/ts/packages/*/package.json`, include those in the run.

**If you cannot detect any manifest file, stop and tell the user.**

## Step 2 — List outdated packages

Run the appropriate command to list what's outdated BEFORE upgrading anything. Show the user what will change.

### Rust
```bash
cargo outdated        # install: cargo install cargo-outdated
cargo update --dry-run
```
**Read the docs:** https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-update.html

### Node.js (npm)
```bash
cd tools/validate-manifest && npm outdated
```

**Read the docs:** https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-update

If `--check-only` was passed, **stop here** and report the outdated list.

## Step 3 — Read the official upgrade docs

**Before running any upgrade command, you MUST fetch and read the official documentation URL listed above for the detected package manager.** Use WebFetch to retrieve the page. This ensures you use the correct flags and understand the behavior. Do not guess at flags or options from memory.

## Step 4 — Upgrade packages

Run the upgrade. If a specific package name was given as an argument, upgrade only that package.

### Rust
```bash
cargo update                          # semver-compatible updates
# --major flag:
cargo update --breaking               # major version bumps (cargo 1.84+)
```
Workspace versions live in `[workspace.dependencies]` in the root `Cargo.toml`. For major bumps you may need to edit those entries by hand and then `cargo update`.

### Node.js (npm)
```bash
cd tools/validate-manifest
npm update                            # semver-compatible (within package.json ranges)
# --major flag:
npx npm-check-updates -u && npm install   # bump package.json to latest majors
```

## Step 5 — Verify the upgrade

After upgrading, run the project's build and test suite to confirm nothing broke:

```bash
make ci
```

If tests fail:
1. Read the failure output carefully
2. Check the changelog / migration guide for the upgraded packages (fetch the release notes URL if available)
3. Fix breaking changes in the code
4. Re-run tests
5. If stuck after 3 attempts on the same failure, report it to the user with the error details and the package that caused it

## Step 6 — Report

Provide a summary:

- Packages upgraded (old version -> new version)
- Packages skipped (and why, e.g., major version bump without `--major` flag)
- Build/test result after upgrade
- Any breaking changes that were fixed
- Any packages that could not be upgraded (with error details)

## Rules

- **Always list outdated packages first** before upgrading anything
- **Always read the official docs** for the package manager before running upgrade commands
- **Always run tests after upgrading** to catch breakage immediately
- **Never remove packages** unless they were explicitly deprecated and replaced
- **Never downgrade packages** unless rolling back a broken upgrade
- **Never modify lockfiles manually** (`Cargo.lock`, `package-lock.json`) — let the package manager regenerate them
- **Commit nothing** — leave changes in the working tree for the user to review

## Success criteria

- All outdated packages upgraded to latest compatible (or latest major if `--major`)
- Build passes
- Tests pass
- User has a clear summary of what changed
